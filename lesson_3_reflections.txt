When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- especially when it's needed to share work with others keeping project public
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- automatically stay up-to-date with remotes can push untested or temporary changes with others
