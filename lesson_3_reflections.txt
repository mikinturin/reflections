When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- especially when it's needed to share work with others keeping project public
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- automatically stay up-to-date with remotes can push untested or temporary changes with others
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- fork is a clone onto github, clone is a copy of the repository, branch start a nonlinear commit tree into a repository
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- this way I can try to merge and locally resolve conflicts before push my changes to the remote
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
- I have to modify my code, send other the files with my comments, wait for their work and comments and so on
