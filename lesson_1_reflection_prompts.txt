How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff output immediately show where to look between large files (hopelly few lines out of thousands!)

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    With entire file history saved, I could look back to past errors and try not to repeat them

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    If I choose when create commits, I choose to commit when I finished a small work and I have a stable new version

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git allow multiple-files commits (grouping them in repositories) because is code-oriented

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log let me see all the commits and their comments; git diff let me see the differences between two versions (for all the files)

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    That's because I can roll back rapidly to previous versions 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    learn how to use branches (fork, merge etc..) and hopefully how to automate deploy
